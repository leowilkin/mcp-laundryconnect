## Use ts!

All you gotta do is:

1. Find the Zone's Business ID (should be on a poster)
2. Find the machine ID by going to the tracking website & inspecting the API calls
3. git clone & npm i
4. Go to your IDE/AI app's MCP settings
5. Add a new server as `npm run dev` with an argument of the folder it's in
  HINT: Check config.example.json for the Claude Desktop config.

OR!

If you use Claude Desktop, download the file in Releases. Ts reccomended option.

Prosper! Never be in the dark about when the next batch of laundry can go in :)
